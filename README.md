# Test Driven Development Task (TDD)

## Summary

This is the first practice case of test driven development in python. Unit tests are created for the cases of modulo, positive numbers and if the remainder of two values divided is zero.

- Test case created to test for 0 remainders. values of `num1` and `num2` 3 and 3 respectively, produce a zero remainder result. Hence they pass the test.

- Test cases created to check for positive values. values of `num1` and `num2` 7 and 3 respectively, are positive values so pass the test.

- Test cases created to check for modulo result. values of `num1` and `num2` 9 and 3 respectively, produce the correct modulo and so pass the test.

- Unit Test kept in `tests.py`
- Code to be tested kept in `cases.py`
